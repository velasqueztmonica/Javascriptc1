// There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
//    a. Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
//    b. Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
//    c. The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
//    d. Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
//    e. Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
//    f. We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
//  g. Built -in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
