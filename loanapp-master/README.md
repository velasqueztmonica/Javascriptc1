# JavaScript Loan App

I build a `User` friendly **Loan App** using `Vanilla JavaScript`. All the functionalities of the App are written in `expressive arrow-functions`. It's a learning curve for seasoned `JavaScript Developers` that want to understand the current trends and what has been added to `JavaScript` in **2019.** The App can be extentend to a bigger application later on via the platform i am building. I am currently working on a cutting edge learning platform for **Tech Lovers all around the world.** The aim of the platform is to offer free skills to the entire tech community all around the globe.

    **Features**

        * Arrow functions
        * Spinner
        * Dynamic messages
        * DOM
